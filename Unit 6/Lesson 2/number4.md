4. List the two things wrong with the following code and how to fix it.
    ```python
    function subtract(a):
        print(a - b)
       
    
    subtract(5, 7)
    ```

The function should be named def, not function.

Also, the function should take have 2 parameters.

So, it should look like:

    ```python
    def subtract(a,b):
        print(a - b)
       
    
    subtract(5, 7)
    ```
